GFWList2PAC
===========

This one is deperaced. please see [wisicn/run_gfwlist2pac](https://github.com/wisicn/run_gfwlist2pac)

Generate fast PAC file from gfwlist. Examples: [fast mode] / [precise mode].

Fast mode: use O(1) domain lookup

Precise mode: use adblock plus engine


### Usage

    pip install gfwlist2pac
    
    usage: gfwlist2pac [-h] [-i GFWLIST] -f PAC -p PROXY [--user-rule USER_RULE]
                   [--precise]

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -i GFWLIST, --input GFWLIST
                            path to gfwlist
      -f PAC, --file PAC    path to output pac
      -p PROXY, --proxy PROXY
                            the proxy parameter in the pac file, for example,
                            "SOCKS5 127.0.0.1:1080;"
      --user-rule USER_RULE
                            user rule file, which will be appended to gfwlist
      --precise             use adblock plus algorithm instead of O(1) lookup

### Usage Example

    A command usage example is in test/run.sh.
    A user defined rule file is in test/user_rule.txt

### Performance

The PAC generated by GFWList2PAC is 1900x faster than SwitchySharp.
